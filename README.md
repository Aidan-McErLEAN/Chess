# Chess (Ulster University Group Project)

This was an Ulster University Magee group project for (Object-Oriented Programming). In this project, we were given skeleton code and came together as a group to assign methods to each other, however, we helped each other throughout the entirety of the project. You can see the methods I was assigned to down below:


updateBoard

getValue

getAllWhiteMoves

getAllBlackMoves

checkBoardStatus
